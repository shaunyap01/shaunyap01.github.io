      <description>On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump declared &amp;#39;Liberation Day&amp;#39;, unveiling aggressive new tariffs designed to correct trade imbalances via a controversial formula from the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). This tariff equation, which aims to achieve a bilateral trade balance of zero, adjusts rates based on export-import disparities, elasticity of demand, and tariff passthrough. This article focuses on explaining the Trump Tariff formula to all with worked examples and offering Python tools to replicate and validate the data.</description>

      <description>Awarded Best Dissertation in Cohort, this MSc project explores the detection of climate and environmental misinformation on social media using a comparative framework of traditional natural language processing techniques, deep learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Leveraging a web-scraped dataset from PolitiFact, the study highlights the superiority of CNNs trained on ordinal truthfulness data, with accuracy boosted from 80.1% to 84.0% through GPT-4o-driven feature augmentation. While LLMs enhanced contextual understanding and sentiment analysis, their time complexity posed practical limitations. The project contributes novel insights into model performance trade-offs, evaluation metrics tailored to ordinal classification, and the practical integration of LLMs for misinformation mitigation in climate discourse.</description>
